# Dragon Appreciation Day 
This is a pun website about the traditional and folk dragons in the Philippines and the dragons that we see in our modern lives.

## Experience
The idea, design, and content generation was quick. I did had some trouble during coding. It was a rough ride and I still need to finish things up.

## Problems
The main problem I encountered was linking the CSS to the HTML. I also had some minor troubles where I knew how I wanted the page to look but I just don't know what code to use and how to use it. The minor problems were simple; I only had to google them and everything just added up. For the CSS, I did recieve help from a colleague. He tried different things but it all ended up in deleting a typographical error.

## Todos
I will definitely update it to make it look my intended design.
