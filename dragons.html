		<h1>DRAGONS</h1>
		<h2>Traditional vs Modern</h2>
	<p class="box">
		In myths and legends of the world, dragons are often fire-breathing, reptilelike creatures with wings, huge claws, and a long tail. They are usually portrayed as frightening and destructive monsters. Gods and heroes must slay them in symbolic battles of good over evil. But a few cultures, notably those of China and Japan, view dragons in a positive light and use them as symbols of good fortune.
		In these times, dragons have evolved and adapted into modern practices as theorized by Darwin on his book "On the Origin of Species". This website is to reeducate ourselves with the Philippines version of dragons according to folklore and to rediscover in a new light the existing dragons which are unnoticed.
