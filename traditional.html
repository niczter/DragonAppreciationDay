		<h1>Traditional Dragon</h1>
		<h2>The Bakunawa</h2>

		<p>The Bakunawa, also spelled Bakonawa, Baconaua, or Bakonaua, is a dragon in Philippine mythology that is often represented as a gigantic sea serpent. It is believed to be the cause of eclipses.
		It appears as a giant sea serpent with a mouth the size of a lake, a red tongue, whiskers, gills, small wires at its sides, and two sets of wings, one is large and ash-gray while the other is small and is found further down its body.
		The Visayan (Cebuano) term bakunawa is the direct translation of the word 'eclipse'. Binakunawa is a verb to mean "to cause an eclipse".</p>
